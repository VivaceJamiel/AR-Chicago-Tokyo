# AR-Chicago-Tokyo-jimpoy2

# Summary
This is an augmented reality project to display models using vuforia on cubes. The models displayed are of places that I have chosen that are interesting to me.
The first model is nikuyokocho, a famous restaurant alley in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan that is known for its meat and protein focused foods. I have visited there and the models represent how I view the place.
The second model is Millenium Park in Chicago, Illinois. I frequent the park whenever I have free time and visit a lot of places and attraction in the park

# Nikuyokocho Models

## Shiba Inu
When I visted Nikutyokocho, there was a Shiba Inu that was sitting outside one of the restaurants. It really stuck with me the whole time I was there and I could not stop passing by to say hi to the dog.

## Torii Gate
There was a Torii Shrine gate that was part of a restaurant or an entrance to the alley. I couldn't remember exactly because it has been nearly a decade since I've been there.

## Sushi platter
When my family and I went to the restaurant, at the time, I hadn't gotten around to liking meat and beef all that much. So I ordered salmon sushi, which was interesting because the alley was known for meat
This model was created by me, in Blender

## Vending Machine
Japan is known for its vending machine in public areas. When I went to Nikuyokocho, I found the vending machines really cool as a child. I would always ask for money to get a canned drink even though I wasn't interested in the drink. I was more interested in the vending machine dispensing the drink.

## Ramen Yatai
In the alley, there was a Ramen Food stall, also called a Ramen Yatai. I found it really cool when my parents told me that the stall itself is able to be rolled around and be moved to another place, making it really portable and able to serve ramen anywhere.

# Chicago Models

## Buckingham Fountain
This fountain is pretty iconic when thinking about Millenium Park. My family would always show relatives the fountain when they would come and visit Chicago. I occasionally drop by the fountain on a warm day and stay in the misty areas.

## Ice Rink
During the winter months, the area under the bean is converted to an ice rink. This is memerable to me because I had gone Ice skating there for the first time near New Years. It was tiring but well worth the experience.

## Lion Statues
The lion statues are representing the lion statues at the stairs of the Art Institute of Chicago. I would always pass by the statues when I visit the museum for the purposes of class and my own personal enjoyment.
The models are imported.

## Crown Fountains
This Crown Fountains are my favorite place to be at in Millenium Park. I would always just wade in the water when I'm feeling extra warm that day and seeing the faces are always so funny.
The model is made by me, in Blender.
Faces are imported.

## Cloud Gate
An iconic attraction in Millenium Park. It's always visible for most of the park and its a place people always go to, including myself, when visiting.
